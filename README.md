# Flutter Accounting App Demo

Hi! 👋 I'm Xhevdet, and this is a small Flutter app I built to help keep track of income and expenses in a simple and clean way.

I didn’t want anything complicated — just a lightweight solution that’s easy to use and looks good. This project helped me explore Flutter app structure, state management, and clean UI design.

---

## What the app does

- Add income or expenses with a short description
- Instantly see your current balance update
- Browse a list of your recent transactions
- Works smoothly on mobile with a minimal interface

---

## Why I built it

Most finance apps out there are too complex or overloaded with features. I wanted something I could fully control and build myself from scratch. This app keeps things simple — and it's also part of my developer portfolio as I apply for remote Flutter jobs.

## What's coming next

- Login system and user accounts (using Supabase)
- Monthly charts and visual stats (bar and pie charts)
- Export to PDF or Excel
- Sync across multiple devices

## Screenshots

These screenshots show how the app works in practice:

| Home Screen (static)                    | Add Transaction Screen                  | Home Screen (dynamic)                     |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| ![Static Home](assets/screenshots/01_home_screen_static.png) | ![Add](assets/screenshots/02_add_transaction_screen.png) | ![Dynamic](assets/screenshots/03_home_screen_dynamic.png) |

You'll be able to view your current balance, add transactions, and review your financial activity all in one place. The interface is clean and user-friendly — no need to be a finance expert.
