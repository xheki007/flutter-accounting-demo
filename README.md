# Flutter Accounting App Demo

This is a simple Flutter app for tracking personal income and expenses.

I created this project as part of my portfolio to demonstrate how I build and structure real Flutter apps — clean UI, simple logic, and focused on the essentials.

---

## Why I built it

The idea came from the need for a lightweight app that helps users keep track of their daily transactions without the complexity of full accounting tools.

It's also a chance to show how I organize code, handle state, and plan for future backend integrations.
