# Flutter Accounting App Demo

Hi! 👋 I'm Xhevdet, and this is a small Flutter app I built to manage income and expenses in a simple way.

I didn’t want anything complex — just something clean, fast, and easy to use. This project helped me explore how to structure a Flutter app, work with simple logic for finance tracking, and design a clear user interface.

---

## What the app does

- Add an income or an expense, with a short description
- See your current balance update instantly
- Browse a list of your latest transactions
- Enjoy a minimal, mobile-friendly interface

---

## Why I built it

There are many apps out there, but most are too heavy or packed with features I personally don’t need. I wanted something lighter — and more importantly, something I could build myself, from scratch.

This app is also part of my developer portfolio. I’m aiming to work remotely as a Flutter developer, and I wanted to show what I can do.

---

## What’s coming next

- Login system and user accounts (with Supabase)
- Visual charts for monthly stats (pie/bar)
- Export to PDF or Excel
- Sync across devices

Below are some screenshots showing the flow and functionality of the app:
