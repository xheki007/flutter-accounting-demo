# Flutter Accounting App Demo

This is a simple personal finance app built with **Flutter**. It allows users to track their income and expenses in a clean and minimal interface.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how I structure a Flutter application, manage state, and handle basic logic such as calculating balances and listing transactions.

## Features

- Add income or expense entries
- View running balance
- See a list of all transactions with date and value
- Responsive layout and basic styling

## Built With

- **Flutter** – UI framework
- **Dart** – Programming language
- **setState** – For basic state management
- **Supabase (Planned)** – For user authentication and data storage

## Motivation

I built this app as a portfolio project to showcase my development skills for remote opportunities. It’s intentionally simple, with room to grow (e.g., Supabase integration, login system, charts, etc.)

## Future Improvements

- Integrate Supabase for user auth and persistent storage
- Add visual charts (e.g., bar/pie graphs)
- Multi-user support
- Export to CSV or PDF
